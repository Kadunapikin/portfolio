                    <p class="p1">As a dynamic leader known for my affable nature, 
                        I bring a unique blend of diverse technical expertise and passions to the table. 
                        My meticulous attention to detail and robust organizational prowess make me an invaluable team collaborator, 
                        adept at juggling multiple projects with precision and accuracy. 
                        I'm on the lookout for a full-time opportunity where I can embrace professional challenges, 
                        leveraging my innate interpersonal acumen, superior time management capabilities, 
                        and astute problem-solving skills.</p>
                    <p class="p2">Currently, I have the privilege of remotely mentoring budding developers 
                        at 'TOP Developers in Nigeria', guiding them towards realizing their career aspirations 
                        in the tech industry.</p>

                    <h4>My Work History</h4>
                    <p class="p1">For seven years, I dedicated myself to the agricultural loan sector, 
                        holding key roles at LAPO and Letshego Micro Finance Banks. 
                        I pioneered loan products that elevated the income of SMEs and rural farmers,
                         boosted agricultural productivity, and funneled more financial resources into 
                         agriculture. Additionally, I was instrumental in modernizing rural farming practices, 
                         strengthening Nigeria's agricultural value chain.</p>
                    <p class="p2">Currently, I volunteer at TOP Software Developers in Kaduna, Nigeria. 
                        I play an active role in team projects, collaborating with other front-end developers 
                        for seamless project deployment on GitHub. As a team leader, I delegate tasks, offer feedback, 
                        and ensure smooth operations.</p>

                    <h4>My Personal History</h4>
                    <p>Having graduated in 2013 with a Diploma in Agricultural Extension from Nuhu Bamalli Polytechnic, 
                        I joined LAPO MFB in 2015. My commitment earned me the Best Client Support Officer Award in 2017. 
                        By 2019, I was leading agricultural teams for Letshego MFB across three states. However, 
                        drawn to the tech world, I shifted my focus in 2022 to pursue Front End Development with 
                        TOP Software Developers, setting my sights on becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer.</p>
                    <p class="p2">Currently mastering the MERN-Stack (MongoDB, Express, React JS, Node JS) at 
                        TOP Software Developers Nigeria, with a parallel focus on remotely mentoring 
                        budding developers to reach their tech aspirations.</p>
